# xmmregion Project

> A hybrid Bash-Python toolkit designed to streamline *diffuse X-ray* spectral extraction from complex and numerous X-ray regions in XMM-Newton observations.


## Overview

The **Science Analysis System (SAS)** of ESA’s **X-ray Multi-Mirror Mission (XMM-Newton)** is a collection of tasks, scripts, and libraries developed to reduce and analyze observational data. It is built using C, Fortran, and Perl. Within SAS, the **XMM-Newton Extended Source Analysis Software (XMM-ESAS)** is specifically designed to handle diffuse X-ray emission from various extended structures.

However, XMM-ESAS has a significant limitation: it cannot efficiently extract diffuse spectra from more than approximately 40 regions simultaneously. This becomes particularly challenging when working with complex, pixel-defined region files. The following image shows an example from the Galactic Center’s Sgr B region. In this case, the user aims to extract spectra from all non-black pixels (each representing a 30×30 arcsecond area on the sky), which is difficult to achieve using ESAS alone.

`xmmregion` is an automated toolkit developed to address this limitation. It streamlines the process of spectral extraction from a large number of region files (down to the pixel level) making it significantly easier to analyze spatially complex, extended X-ray sources. The toolkit is particularly useful in scenarios that require custom, pixel-by-pixel masking.



## Method

The standard XMM-Newton spectral extraction pipeline using XMM-ESAS must be **paused** before region based filtering begins. This is where `xmmregion` takes over, providing automated preprocessing to generate region files based on pixel level masks.

The workflow proceeds as follows:

1. **Pause Standard Pipeline**  
   Begin by stopping the standard XMM-Newton ESAS pipeline before region-based filtering starts (after `pn-filter` and `mos-filter`.

2. **Create a Binary Pixel Mask (FITS file)**  
   Generate a FITS image where each pixel has a value of `1` if it should be **excluded** from the spectral analysis.


3. **Convert to Sky and Detector Coordinates**  
   Convert this binary mask into Ds9 .reg files on XMM-Newton sky coordinates, and then into **detector coordinates**, while accounting for the orientation and rotation of the onboard EPIC cameras.

4. **Apply Geometric Transformations**  
   Use the `conv_reg` method to apply necessary camera rotations and transformations to align regions correctly in detector space.

5. **Translate to FITS Tables with Metadata**  
   Convert the region files (.reg) into special FITS tables that include relevant metadata needed by ESAS.

7. **Resume ESAS Pipeline**  
   Integrate the generated FITS region files into the standard ESAS workflow and continue spectral extraction as usual.


This modular approach allows users to define hundreds of regions based on pixel-level masks and automate their integration into ESAS without manual region creation or editing. For the moment only `box, rot-box` and `circular` regions are possible.
